# OOP Project

This project reads in multiple files and generates an index of the most common words excluding the most popular 1000 words acroding to google.
It then displays the words with the page number they are on aswel as the varius descriptions from the dictionary.csv file provided.

My version of the app brings up a gui file picker to let you pick files quickly aswell as using good defaults to start using it quickly.
As you go through the menus it will print messages telling you what is happening.
My options for letting you see the output of the file is.

1. Output all words ascending
2. Output all words descending
3. Output total number of unique words
4. The top n most frequent words with **descriptions**
    - Let the user input the number of words to show
